# Terraform Quickstart Guide

## What is Terraform?
Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language, HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language). Terraform configurations are written in files with a `.tf` extension and emphasize **idempotency**, meaning applying the same configuration multiple times will produce the same result without changing the existing infrastructure.

## Variables
### Command Line Precedence
The command line `-var` option takes precedence over any variables defined in the variables file.

### Variable Types
- **String, Number, Boolean**
- **List**: Zero-indexed collections
    ```hcl
    variable "prefix" {
        default = ["Mr", "Mrs", "Sir"]
        type    = list
    }
    
    resource "random_pet" "my_pet" {
        prefix = var.prefix[0]
    }
    ```
- **Map**: Key-value pairs
    ```hcl
    variable "ami" {
        type = map
        default = {
            "ami1" = "AsdfasdFASDF"
            "ami2" = "!23213213!"
        }
    }
    
    resource "ami" {
        ami = var.ami["ami1"]
    }
    ```

### Data Structures
| Feature           | List            | Tuple             | Object                         |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| Element Types     | Homogeneous     | Heterogeneous     | Heterogeneous                  |
| Ordered/Unordered | Ordered         | Ordered           | Unordered                      |
| Access Method     | By index        | By index          | By key                         |
| Common Use Cases  | Similar items   | Different types   | Grouping related attributes    |

### Objects
Combines multiple data types efficiently.

## Resource Attributes
Resources can depend on each other. Use outputs from one resource to configure another.

```hcl
resource "aws_internet_gateway" "gateway" {
    vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

    tags = {
        Name = "main_gateway"
    }
}

resource "aws_route_table" "route_table" {
    vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id

    route {
        cidr_block = "0.0.0.0/0"
        gateway_id = aws_internet_gateway.gateway.id
    }
}
```

## Resource Dependencies
Terraform typically manages resource dependencies implicitly. Explicit dependencies can be defined using `depends_on`.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-unique-bucket-name"
  acl    = "private"
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "example_policy" {
  name   = "example_policy"
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action   = ["s3:*"]
        Effect   = "Allow"
        Resource = ["arn:aws:s3:::my-unique-bucket-name/*"]
      }
    ]
  })
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.example]
}
```

## Output Command
To print output variables, use the `output` block.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "example" {
  bucket = "my-example-bucket-123456"
  acl    = "private"
}

output "bucket_name" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.example.bucket
}

output "bucket_arn" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.example.arn
}
```

## Terraform State
Terraform maintains a state file (`tfstate`) to track infrastructure changes. This state file acts as a blueprint for the current configuration.

### Collaboration
State files can be stored remotely (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) to allow team collaboration and ensure consistency.

### Performance
Refers to the state file for infrastructure tracking. Sensitive data should be securely stored.

## Terraform Commands
| Command           | Usage                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| terraform init    | Initializes a new or existing Terraform configuration.                |
| terraform plan    | Creates an execution plan to achieve the desired state.               |
| terraform apply   | Applies the changes required to reach the desired state.              |
| terraform destroy | Destroys all Terraform-managed infrastructure.                        |
| terraform validate| Validates configuration files for syntax and consistency.             |
| terraform fmt     | Formats configuration files to a canonical style.                     |
| terraform show    | Displays information about the state or execution plan.               |
| terraform output  | Reads and outputs values of output variables.                         |
| terraform state   | Inspects and modifies the state file.                                 |
| terraform import  | Imports existing resources into the state.                            |
| terraform taint   | Marks a resource for recreation on the next `apply`.                  |
| terraform untaint | Removes the "tainted" state from a resource.                          |

## Lifecycle Rules

There are certain scenarios where we don't want Terraform to delete the infrastructure when we apply changes. In these cases, we can use lifecycle rules:

```hcl
lifecycle {
    create_before_destroy = true
}

lifecycle {
    prevent_destroy = true
}
```

### Key Lifecycle Arguments

- **`create_before_destroy`**: Ensures that a new resource is created before the old one is destroyed.
- **`prevent_destroy`**: Prevents the resource from being destroyed.
- **`ignore_changes`**: Specifies attributes to ignore when determining if a resource needs updating.

## Terraform Data Sources

Data sources are used to read a text file or fetch content from an existing resource. They are declared using the `data` block.

Terraform data sources allow you to fetch data from external sources or existing resources in your infrastructure, which can be used to configure other resources.

### Step 1: Define the Data Source

Use a data source to fetch the VPC ID of an existing VPC.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

data "aws_vpc" "selected" {
  filter {
    name   = "tag:Name"
    values = ["my-vpc"]
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Use the Data Source in a Resource

Next, create a subnet within the fetched VPC using the data source.

```hcl
resource "aws_subnet" "example" {
  vpc_id            = data.aws_vpc.selected.id
  cidr_block        = "10.0.1.0/24"
  availability_zone = "us-west-2a"

  tags = {
    Name = "example-subnet"
  }
}
```

---

## Terraform Meta Arguments

### Key Meta Arguments

1. **`count`**
   - This creates the resource with the specified number.

   ```hcl
   resource "local_file" "pet" {
       filename = var.filename[count.index] # Set the file name using index in the list below
       count    = length(var.filename)
   }

   variable "filename" {
       default = [
           "root/pet.txt",
           "root/dog.txt",
           "root/duck.txt"
       ]
   }
   ```

   **Note:** The problem with `count` is that it will recreate the resources if variables are modified, which is not ideal. That's why we need `for_each`.

2. **`for_each`**
   - More usable than `count`.

   ```hcl
   resource "local_file" "pet" {
       filename = each.value
       for_each = toset(var.filename)
   }

   variable "filename" {
       type    = set(string)  # Important to ensure uniqueness
       default = [
           "root/pet.txt",
           "root/dog.txt",
           "root/duck.txt"
       ]
   }
   ```

3. **`depends_on`**
4. **`provider`**
5. **`lifecycle`**

---

## Version Constraints

Provider plugins vary from one to another. The provider documentation in the registry specifies the version, starting with `terraform`.

```hcl
terraform {  # Remember the constraint is set to terraform here
    required_providers {
        local = {
            source  = "hashicorp/local"
            version = "1.4.0"
        }
    }
}
```

---

## Remote State

- Understanding local state files vs remote state files is crucial.
- It is not advisable to store state files in a repository. Why? A developer writes a Terraform script in an S3 bucket and proceeds to apply it, which creates a state file locally and in the repo.
- State files store sensitive information, such as IP addresses, databases, and passwords.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **State locking** is a very important feature, and Git does not store state locking. 
Store it in AWS S3, Consul, GCP Storage, or Terraform Cloud.
</aside>

---

## Remote State Locking

To enable remote state locking, you need an S3 bucket and state locking.
